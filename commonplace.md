1. Develop a taste for having problems. Give each one the time it requires.
2. Embrace radical incrementalism. Slow and steady progress. Don't do too much in one day.
3. Distinctive work begins after the trial and error phase of copying others, learning new skills, and accumulating experience.

"in the words of the American meditation teacher Joseph Goldstein, 'a plan is just a thought.' We treat our plans as though they are a lasso, thrown from the present around the future, in order to bring it under our command. But all a plan is—all it could ever possibly be—is a present-moment statement of intent."

The United States plan to attack the Soviet Union (and China) was absolutely horrifying...
"featured 3,729 targets, grouped into more than 1,000 ground zeros, that would be struck by 3,423 nuclear weapons. The targets were located in the Soviet Union, China, North Korea, and Eastern Europe. About 80 percent were military targets, and the rest were civilian. ... Within three days of the initial attack, the full force of the SIOP would kill about 54 percent of the Soviet Union's population and about 16 percent of China's population—roughly 220 million people. Millions more would subsequently die from burns, radiation poisoning, exposure. The SIOP was designed for a national emergency, when the survival of the United States was at stake, and the decision to launch the SIOP would carry an almost unbearable weight. Once the SIOP was set in motion, it could not be altered, slowed, or stopped."

"the first mainframes produced by IBM. They were the largest, fastest, and most expensive computers in the world. Each of them contained about 25,000 vacuum tubes and covered about half an acre of floor space. Analog signals from early-warning radar sites were converted into digital bits and sent via AT&T's telephone lines to SAGE direction centers, where the huge computers decided whether an aircraft was friend or foe. If it appeared to be an enemy bomber, the computers automatically sent details about its flight path to the nearest missile batteries and fighter planes. Those details were also sent to NORAD headquarters. Human beings would decide whether or not to shoot down the plane. But that decision would be based on information gathered, sorted, and analyzed by machines. In many respects SAGE created the template for the modern computer industry, introducing technologies that would later become commonplace: analog to digital conversion, data transmission over telephone lines, video monitors, graphic displays, magnetic core memory, duplexing, multiprocessing, large-scale software programming, and the light gun, a handheld early version of the mouse. The attempt to create a defense against Soviet bombers helped to launch a technological revolution."

"Ikle suggested that the Second World War strategy of targeting civilians had failed to achieve its aims. The casualties were disproportionately women, children, and the elderly—not workers essential to the war effort. Cities adapted to the bombing, and their morale wasn't easily broken. Even in Hiroshima, the desire to fight back survived the blast: when rumors spread that San Francisco, San Diego, and Los Angeles had been destroyed by Japanese atomic bombs, people became lighthearted and cheerful, hoping the war could still be won."

"if you have more than one reason to do something (choose a doctor or veterinarian, hire a gardener or an employee, marry a person, go on a trip), just don't do it. It does not mean that one reason is better than two, just that by invoking more than one reason you are trying to convince yourself to do something. Obvious decisions (robust to error) require no more than a single reason. Likewise the French army had a heuristic to reject excuses for absenteeism for more than one reason, like death of grandmother, cold virus, and being bitten by a boar. If someone attacks a book or idea using more than one argument, you know it is not real: nobody says "he is a criminal, he killed many people, and he also has bad table manners and bad breath and is a very poor driver." I have often followed what I call Bergson's razor: "A philosopher should be known for one single idea, not more""

"[be wary of] positive advice, and only positive advice, exploiting our gullibility and sucker-proneness for recipes that hit you in a flash as just obvious, then evaporate later as you forget them. ... Yet in practice it is the negative that's used by the pros, those selected by evolution: chess grandmasters usually win by not losing; people become rich by not going bust (particularly when others do); religions are mostly about interdicts; the learning of life is about what to avoid. You reduce most of your personal risks of accident thanks to a small number of measures."

"exposure is more important than knowledge; decision effects supersede logic. The need to focus on the payoff from your actions instead of studying the structure of the world has been largely missed in intellectual history. Horribly missed. The payoff, what happens to you (the benefits or harm from it), is always the most important thing, not the event itself. Philosophers talk about truth and falsehood. People in life talk about payoff, exposure, and consequences (risks and rewards), hence fragility and antifragility"

Now take a look at architectural objects around us: they appear so geometrically sophisticated, from the pyramids to the beautiful cathedrals of Europe. So a sucker problem would make us tend to believe that mathematics led to these beautiful objects... architects relied on heuristics, empirical methods, and tools, and almost nobody knew any mathematics—according to the medieval science historian Guy Beaujouan, before the thirteenth century no more than five persons in the whole of Europe knew how to perform a division.

People always forget the square root behind variance!
Explains: Why men are both smarter and dumber than women on average: they have more variability because of only 1 X chromosome (which has mental traits) instead of 2.
E.g., If the standard dev of a coin's weight is 1 gram.
If you have 400 coins, you should expect not 400 grams of variance but twenty (square root of 400)!
Also explains why the counties with lowest population have the highest and lowest cancer rates: as population decreases, the variance increases.

Groupthink is a psychological phenomenon that occurs within a group of people in which the desire for harmony or conformity in the group results in an irrational or dysfunctional decision-making outcome.
Cohesiveness, or the desire for cohesiveness, in a group that may produce a tendency among its members to agree at all costs.
This causes the group to minimize conflict and reach a consensus decision without critical evaluation.

Historical example of crowd psychology include medieval Europe's euthasium in the Crusades, Witch trials in 1600's, and Nazi Europe.

[page 143 - 168] Prior probability is prior to seeing evidence.
Posterior probability is after seeing evidence, and is constantly updated.
Bayes Theorem tells us how to update our priors after seeing evidence!
P(cause|effect) goes up with P(effect|cause)= ?... goes down with P(effect)= it happens all the time then nbd...
And goes up with P(cause)= unless our cause rarely happens!
The initial probability is either obtained by counting (frequentist) or through an assumption.
For instance, the probability people have a fever if they have the flu is either 1/20 because you counted 1 after seeing 20 people and used that, OR you take a guess based on some other evidence.

"Practically it means there is no such thing as learning without knowledge. Data alone is not enough. But The Master Algorithm by Pedro Domingos refutes this:"
NFT is a lot like the reason Pascal's wager fails. We dont care about all possible worlds - only this one.
If we know something about the world and incorporate it into our learner than it will do better than random guessing."
Although the anti argument is that the so called knowledge of our world comes from induction and is fallible.

"Suppose Alex will only date a man if his niceness plus his handsomeness exceeds some threshold.
Then nicer men do not have to be as handsome to qualify for Alex's dating pool.
So, among the men that Alex dates, Alex may observe that the nicer ones are less handsome on average (and vice versa), even if these traits are uncorrelated in the general population.
Berkson's negative correlation is an effect that arises within the dating pool: the rude men that Alex dates must have been even more handsome to qualify."

Libet showed that this buildup occurs before the person consciously makes a decision to move.
The conscious experience of deciding to act, which we usually associate with free will, appears to be an add-on, a post hoc reconstruction of events that occurs after the brain has already set the act in motion.

Pg. 29 - "Make for yourself a definition or description of the thing which is presented to you, so as to see distinctly what kind of a thing it is in substance... For nothing so produces an elevation of the mind as to be able to examine methodically and truly every object which is presented to you in life."

Pg.42 - "Observe constantly that all things take place by change, and accustom yourself to consider that the nature of the universe loves nothing so much as to change the things which are and to make new things like them. For everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be."

Pg. 358. The idea that Rome stopped expanding because the peoples around them were militarily stronger is nonsense. It stopped because the political social system created by Augustus discouraged long campaigns. Emperors just did not trust anyone to do this for them and wanted to spend as much time in Rome as possible.

Pg. 379. One of the best things a general could do was just act as a witness. To deeds of valour, courage and cowardice, soldiers wanted to be seen! And rewarded! And others scolded!

Pg. 286 - a chess expert thinks on a different level than the novice. A master rarely looks further ahead than the novice, a master usually examines only a handful of possible moves. The trick is that his/her mind acts as a filterm they don't even see the bad moves! Experts in general think in higher level chunks.

Pg. 253 - "A computer processor does moronically simple things - moves a byte to/from memory, adds a byte to another byte. The only reason anything substantial gets done is because it all happens so many times so quickly"

"If you put 90 percent of your funds in boring cash (assuming you are protected from inflation) or something called a "numeraire repository of value," and 10 percent in very risky, maximally risky, securities, you cannot possibly lose more than 10 percent, while you are exposed to massive upside."

"If you "have optionality," you don't have much need for what is commonly called intelligence, knowledge, insight, skills, ... you don't have to be right that often.
All you need is the wisdom to not do unintelligent things to hurt yourself (some acts of omission) and recognize favorable outcomes when they occur.
... evolution can produce astonishingly sophisticated objects without intelligence, simply thanks to a combination of optionality and some type of a selection filter, plus some randomness"
